- Q: What is the relationship between early life aptitude and later life labor market outcomes?

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), I examine how indicators of aptitude, self-esteem, and sense of control during respondents' early adulthood translate into later life labor market outcomes such as employment status, income and wages, occupation, and having employer-provided health insurance coverage.

# Folders 
- code: Code documentation 
- data: Contains raw NLSY79 files (uploaded on github temporarily). 
- doc: Data documentation 
- out: Shareable output 
    - Exploratory 
    - Final 
- draft: Draft of written piece  

# Workflow
- Set up local virtual environment 
- Files found in folder "code" can be run in the order that follows to replicate: 
    - (1) dct_mapping
    - (2) special_treatments
    - (3) clsSource
    - (4) setup_plots
    - (5) plots_dataset_overview
    - (6) plots_aptitude_measures
